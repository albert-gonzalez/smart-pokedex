# Smart Pokédex App

Smart Pokédex is a mobile app made with React Native. It uses the [Favware GraphQL Pokémon API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@favware/graphql-pokemon) to get the pokémon data.

The App has 2 different screens:

- Pokémon of the Day: It shows a different pokémon every day
- Explore: You can search pokémon by number, name and type.

The project is unit tested with Jest and e2e tested with Cypress.
